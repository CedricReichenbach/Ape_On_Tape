<h1>Welcome to Apes with Capes!</h1>
<p>We are absolutely greatful for you to help us, sir!</p>
There's a certain competition between apes who own a top hat, and its a bloody rutheless competition! HUAH! Every year the rich and famous among the primate family get together to find out who's gonna be the this year's owner of the CAPE! Certainly they won't be running themselves, they just send their beta to alpha primates to run for them... as well.. huh.. not everybody gets out alive.

So, Good Look Primate!
