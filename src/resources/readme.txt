To create a map use the template or make sure that:
- properties contains an element called 'subdivisions' which is the number of subdivided tiles (must not be 0!)
- the entity tileset must be called 'entities'
- the image path to all tilesets except the entity tileset must be image paths to the location of the tileset in the client folder
